# My Journey in Public Health and Community Advocacy

My career has been defined by a commitment to bridging health equity gaps in vulnerable communities, particularly in HIV/STI prevention and LGBTQ+ health. After earning my BA in Public Health from the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa in 2017, I immediately put my education into action, launching Honolulu's first PrEP navigation program at the Hawaii Health and Harm Reduction Center. That program exceeded enrollment targets by 300% in its first year—a testament to both the community's need and my ability to translate public health principles into accessible, community-centered care.

My expertise deepened during my time with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, where I wore multiple hats. As an HIV/STI Disease Intervention Specialist and later as a Coordinator for Public Health Preparedness, I provided direct care to over 200 individuals newly diagnosed with syphilis or HIV while simultaneously developing training curricula for first responders during the 2022 MPOX outbreak. My work reached beyond clinical spaces—I designed public health messaging campaigns that generated over 10,000 social media impressions, demonstrating my understanding that effective public health requires meeting people where they are.

Now pursuing my MPH at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, I've seamlessly integrated my professional experience with academic leadership. As President of both the Advocates for Asian, Pacific Islander, Desi-American Health and the Queer Health Task-Force, I'm directing recruitment strategies, facilitating mentorship pipelines, and spearheading digital campaigns that advance LGBTQ+ inclusion across campus. Through Project STAY, I continue hands-on work as a Sexual Health Educator, delivering counseling sessions to youth who are vulnerable to HIV/STIs.
